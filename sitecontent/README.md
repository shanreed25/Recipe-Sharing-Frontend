# Breakfast
**Vegan breakfast and brunch categories feature plant-based takes on traditional dishes, as well as creative new concepts. Many recipes use tofu, chickpea flour, or legumes to replace eggs and meat, while other categories focus on grains, fruits, and vegetables.**
- Sweet breakfasts
    - These categories include classic and creative takes on pancakes, waffles, muffins, and more
- Savory breakfasts
    - These categories often rely on protein-rich ingredients like tofu and legumes to create satisfying, hearty meals
- Oats, grains, and puddings
    - This is a staple category for vegan breakfast, featuring simple staples as well as more decadent preparations
- Lighter options and beverages
    - For a lighter meal or a refreshing drink, these categories offer simple yet satisfying choices

# Soups and Stews
**Based on preparation and key ingredients, vegan soups and stews can be categorized into these main types**
- Smooth and creamy soups
    - These soups get their velvety texture from blended vegetables, cashews, or coconut milk instead of dairy.  
- Hearty, chunky, and broth-based soups
    - These soups are defined by their textured ingredients, which can include beans, lentils, pasta, and vegetables. 
- Chilis and stews
    - Thicker than soups, these recipes are often simmered for longer and are meant to be a full meal
- Curries and spiced soups
    - Inspired by international cuisine, these dishes rely on complex spice blends and aromatics

## Nutrient-focused and specific ingredient soups
**These categories are based on the main ingredients or health benefits of the soup**
- Squash soups: Focused on different types of squash, such as butternut, pumpkin, or delicata squash.
- Leafy green soups: Utilize dark greens like spinach or kale as the primary ingredient.
- High-protein stews: Centered around protein sources like lentils, chickpeas, and quinoa.
- One-pot meals: Recipes designed for convenience, with all ingredients cooked in a single pot. 

# Salads
**Vegan salads can be categorized in several ways, most often based on their main ingredients, temperature, or function in a meal**
# Based on the main ingredient
Green salads: Feature a base of leafy greens, such as kale, spinach, arugula, or mixed greens.
Grain and pasta salads: Utilize hearty bases like quinoa, couscous, or pasta, mixed with vegetables, herbs, and dressing. These can be very filling.
Legume salads: Center on beans, lentils, or chickpeas for protein and texture. Examples include three-bean salad or lentil salad.
Starchy vegetable salads: Use ingredients like potatoes, sweet potatoes, or cauliflower as the base. Vegan versions of classic potato salad are popular.
Fruit salads: Combine fresh fruits and berries, sometimes with a light dressing or served alongside greens for a sweet contrast. 
# Based on temperature
Cold salads: The most common type, served chilled. Most green, pasta, and legume salads fall into this category.
Warm salads: Often feature warm components, such as roasted vegetables or grains, and are then lightly dressed.
Mixed temperature salads: Can include both cold ingredients (e.g., fresh greens) and warm ingredients (e.g., roasted chickpeas). 
# Based on function or preparation
Composed salads: Ingredients are artfully arranged rather than tossed together. The vegan Cobb salad, with distinct lines of vegetables, is a prime example.
Bound salads: Held together with a thick, creamy dressing, often a vegan mayonnaise. This includes vegan tuna salad made with chickpeas or mashed beans.
Meal-sized salads (bowls): Hearty salads designed to be a complete meal, often including a protein source, grains, and vegetables.
Slaws: Shredded raw vegetables, typically cabbage, carrots, or broccoli, dressed in a vinaigrette or creamy dressing. Vegan coleslaw is a common example.
